# Feedback on Historical Projections

You asked if we should remove the year selector from Projections.

**I recommend keeping it.** Here is why:

## The Value of "Backcasting"
Projecting past years is the **only way to validate your model**.
- How do we know if the new "Age Cliff" logic works?
- Go to a past year (e.g., 2010), find a 43-year-old pitcher.
- Look at his projection for the next season (2011).
- Compare it to his *actual* 2011 stats in the True Ratings tab.

If we remove the dropdown, we are flying blind. We can only guess if our projections are accurate until next season happens. By keeping it, you can "time travel" and verify the model immediately against known outcomes.

**Recommendation:**
Keep the dropdown to allow for this model validation and historical curiosity. If it's confusing, we can add a tooltip explaining that these are "Retro-Projections" based on data available at that time.
